# ps1doc
by qwikrazor87

A PSP plugin to dump PS1 DOCUMENT.DAT manuals to PNG images.

This plugin is currently only supported on a real PSP, since DOCUMENT.DAT manual viewing has been removed from ePSP.
This should work for all 6.XX CFW.

## Usage
- Place ps1doc.prx in ms0:/seplugins/ and enable in ms0:/seplugins/pops.txt.
- Start a PS1 game that has a DOCUMENT.DAT provided in its game folder.
- Press the Home button, select Software Manual.
- The memory stick indicator should blink orange for a few seconds. Once it is done blinking orange then you can exit the PS1 game.
- The images should be dumped to ms0:/DOCS/PS1_<GAME FOLDER>/DOC_XXX.PNG.

## Changelog
### v1.0
- Initial release.
